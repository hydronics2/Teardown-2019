This class occurs in two parts -- Soldering and Programming.

We'll be soldering parts and headers  onto a custom printed circuit board(PCB).  
Once complete, the microController (an Adfruit development board -  [ItsyBitsy M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3727)) sockets onto the PCB female headers.
When you connect the Adafruit M0 microController to your computer it shows up as an external hard drive with pre-loaded example scripts.
